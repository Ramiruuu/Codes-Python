## Encryption and Decryption Program

This Python program allows you to encrypt and decrypt text and files using the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography library. The program supports generating a key, encrypting text, decrypting text, encrypting files, and decrypting files.

Features
<ul>
  <li>Generate an encryption key and save it to a file (secret.key).</li>
  <li>Encrypt and decrypt text using the generated key.</li>
  <li>Encrypt and decrypt files in binary format.</li>
  <li> Simple command-line interface for easy usage.</li>
</ul>

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher

cryptography library


## Installation

1. Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install the cryptography library using pip:

pip install cryptography



## How to Use

1. Generate an Encryption Key

Run the program and select Option 1. This will create a secret.key file in your current directory.

2. Encrypt Text

Choose Option 2 and enter the text you want to encrypt. The program will output the encrypted text.

3. Decrypt Text

Choose Option 3 and provide the encrypted text. The program will return the decrypted text if the correct key is available.

4. Encrypt a File

Choose Option 4 and specify the file you want to encrypt. This will replace the original file with its encrypted version.

5. Decrypt a File

Choose Option 5 and provide the encrypted file. The program will decrypt the file and replace the encrypted content with the original data.

## Example Usage

Encrypting and Decrypting Text:

Enter text to encrypt: HelloWorld123
Encrypted text: gAAAAABf1Hb... (truncated)

Encrypting and Decrypting a File:

Enter the filename to encrypt: sample.txt  
sample.txt has been encrypted.

Important Notes

Keep the secret.key file safe. Without it, you wonâ€™t be able to decrypt your data.

Always back up your files before encrypting them.

This program encrypts files in place, meaning the original file will be replaced with the encrypted/decrypted version.
